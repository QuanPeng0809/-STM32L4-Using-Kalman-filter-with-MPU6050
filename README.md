# -STM32L4-Using-Kalman-filter-with-MPU6050
This code is not professional, but i think it will be help new user, who start with stm32l476 reduce the time to familar with this 
microcontroller
Using Kalman filter with data read from MPU6050

To run this code on your device, you should run file DigitRecorgnizr.ioc on cubeMX, after that, 
generate code. This step will be generate fully Drivers for your microcontroller, due to driver folder has too much file, 
i will commit them when i have free time =))

But dont worry, this folder is generated by cubeMX and we dont need to modify anything
Ofcouse, I recommend you shouldn't clone this code and run, you should refer this code in main.c to see the algorithm,
ioc file  to see the way I configed my microcontroller.

Additionally, stmstudio.tsc file is stmstudio file, import this file to stmstudio and see this code's result. 
I highly recommend you using this software to figure your data, it very useful
